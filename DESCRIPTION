Description: Provides an interface to the Wikipedia web application programming
    interface (API), using internet connexion.Three functions provide details for
    a specific Wikipedia page : all links that are present, all pages that link
    to, all the contributions (revisions for main pages, and discussions for talk
    pages). Two functions provide details for a specific user : all contributions,
    and general information (as name, gender, rights or groups). It provides
    additional information compared to others packages, as WikipediR. It does not
    need login. The multiplex network that can be constructed from the results
    of the functions of WikipediaR can be modeled as Stochastic Block Model as in
    Barbillon P., Donnet, S., Lazega E., and Bar-Hen A. : Stochastic Block Models
    for Multiplex networks: an application to networks of researchers, ArXiv
